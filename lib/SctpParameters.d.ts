/**
 * Both OS and MIS are part of the SCTP INIT+ACK handshake. OS refers to the
 * initial number of outgoing SCTP streams that the server side transport creates
 * (to be used by DataConsumers), while MIS refers to the maximum number of
 * incoming SCTP streams that the server side transport can receive (to be used
 * by DataProducers). So, if the server side transport will just be used to
 * create data producers (but no data consumers), OS can be low (~1). However,
 * if data consumers are desired on the server side transport, OS must have a
 * proper value and such a proper value depends on whether the remote endpoint
 * supports  SCTP_ADD_STREAMS extension or not.
 *
 * libwebrtc (Chrome, Safari, etc) does not enable SCTP_ADD_STREAMS so, if data
 * consumers are required,  OS should be 1024 (the maximum number of DataChannels
 * that libwebrtc enables).
 *
 * Firefox does enable SCTP_ADD_STREAMS so, if data consumers are required, OS
 * can be lower (16 for instance). The mediasoup transport will allocate and
 * announce more outgoing SCTM streams when needed.
 *
 * mediasoup-client provides specific per browser/version OS and MIS values via
 * the device.sctpCapabilities getter.
