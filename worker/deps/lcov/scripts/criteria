# criteria
#
#   This script is used as a genhtml "--criteria-script criteria" callback.
#   It is called by genhtml at each level of hierarchy - but ignores all but
#   the top level, and looks only at line coverage.
#
#   Format of the JSON input is:
#     {"line":{"found":10,"hit:2,"UNC":2,..},"function":{...},"branch":{}"
#   Only non-zero elements are included.
#   See the 'criteria-script' section in "man genhtml" for details.
#
#   The coverage criteria implemented here is "UNC + LBC + UIC == 0"
#   If the criterial is violated, then this script emits a single line message
#   to stdout and returns a non-zero exit code.
#
#   If passed the "--suppress" flag, this script will exit with status 0,
#   even if the coverage criteria is not met.
#     genhtml --criteria-script 'path/criteria --signoff' ....
#
#   It is not hard to envision much more complicated coverage criteria.
