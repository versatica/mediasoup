# gitversion [--p4] [--md5] [--prefix path] pathname OR
# gitversion [--p4] [--md5] [--prefix path] --compare old_version new_version pathname
#
#   If the '--p4' flag is used:
#     we assume that the GIT repo is cloned from Perforce - and look for
#     the line in the generated commit log message which tells us the perforce
#     changelist ID that we actually want.
#   If specified, 'path' is prependied to 'pathname' (as 'path/pathname')
#     before processing.

#   This is a sample script which uses git commands to determine
#   the version of the filename parameter.
#   Version information (if present) is used during ".info" file merging
#   to verify that the data the user is attempting to merge is for the same
#   source code/same version.
#   If the version is not the same - then line numbers, etc. may be different
#   and some very strange errors may occur.
